Digital Wishlist App
The Digital Wishlist App allows users to create wishlists for things they want to buy, track price drops, and share their lists with friends and family for gifting ideas. Users can save items they wish to purchase, set alerts for price changes, and receive notifications. This app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and provides a full-stack solution for building and managing a wishlist.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their wishlists securely.
Create and Manage Wishlists: Users can add items to their wishlist, including the name, price, URL, and description of the product.
Price Drop Notifications: Users will receive notifications when the price of an item in their wishlist drops.
Sharing Wishlists: Users can share their wishlists with others, making it easier for friends and family to purchase gifts.
Wishlist Categories: Organize items into categories (e.g., tech, fashion, books) for easier management.
Responsive Design: A fully responsive web app that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
